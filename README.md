Currently, this is a WIP. There will be lots of breaking changes.

In the future, this may be updated by Lawlzer (me), to a more "trustworthy" and "effective" version.

Many things will change in the future (variable names, functions, etc).

However, simply to let you know:
This is similar to most Loggers, except it's a "global" logger. You only need to set it up once, then you can use it anywhere (unlike most loggers, which must share a variable of some sort)
